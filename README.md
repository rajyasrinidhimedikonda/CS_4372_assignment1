  3) Click file and then open notebook.
  4) Choose the file from your downloads in order to open the file contents in colab
  5) Once the code is loaded into colab, click on Runtime and then click run all. This should compile and run all the code in order.
  6) We used a pop command to further test our data. This command is on line that states : X.pop(X.columns[-1]). Please do not rerun this line as it would pop a necessary column out and dirupt our data. If you happen to rerun this line, reopen the file with the same steps and rerun the file. All other commands can be rerun.
  7) Once you click run all, you should be able to see all the numerical and visual analysis of the dataset we chose : wine dataset from UCI ML Repo.
